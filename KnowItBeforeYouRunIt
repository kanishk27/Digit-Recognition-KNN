For the sake of simplicity, 32 x 32 images were used, wherein the digit was written approximately in the centre.

Credits: Shreyans - For gathering the enormous data and converting them to the intermediate stage of 0's and 1's and storing them
into a .txt file.

Libraries used were numpy and collections (for Counter) and the program is written in python3. 

Use the funcAll() function if your your machine's computational power is high, else you'll get an accuracy of 0.0
You can use pickle to directly load the variables instead of reading from the txt files every time. 

That's pretty much it. XD
